Launch a Linux Virtual Machine
===============================
Step 1: Launch an Amazon EC2 Instance
EC2 console > launch instance

Step 2: Configure your Instance
a. Amazon Linux AMI
b. t2.micro > default options
c. review and launch 
d. create new key pair > "MyKeyPair" > Download key pair
Windows users: We recommend saving your key pair in your user directory in a sub-directory called .ssh (ex. C:\user\{yourusername}\.ssh\MyKeyPair.pem).
Mac/Linux users: We recommend saving your key pair in the .ssh sub-directory from your home directory (ex. ~/.ssh/MyKeyPair.pem).
Note: On Mac, the key pair is downloaded to your Downloads directory by default. 
To move the key pair into the .ssh sub-directory, enter the following command in a terminal window: mv ~/Downloads/MyKeyPair.pem ~/.ssh/MyKeyPair.pem

click Launch instance

e. EC2 > View instances
f. make note of public ip address of the new instance

Step 3: Connect to your Instance
Windows users:  Select Windows below to see instructions for installing Git Bash.
Mac/Linux user: Select Mac / Linux below to see instructions for opening a terminal window.

a. instructions to install git bash
b. open git bash to run ssh command
c. connect to your instance

Windows users: Enter ssh -i 'c:\Users\yourusername\.ssh\MyKeyPair.pem' ec2-user@{IP_Address} (ex. ssh -i 'c:\Users\adamglic\.ssh\MyKeyPair.pem' ec2-user@52.27.212.125)
Mac/Linux users: Enter ssh -i ~/.ssh/MyKeyPair.pem ec2-user@{IP_Address} (ex. ssh -i ~/.ssh/MyKeyPair.pem ec2-user@52.27.212.125)

Note: if you started a Linux instance that isn't Amazon Linux, there may by a different user name that is used. 
common user names include ec2-user, root, ubuntu, and fedora. 
If you are unsure what the login user name is, check with your AMI provider.

You'll see a response similar to the following:

The authenticity of host 'ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com (10.254.142.33)' can't be established. 
RSA key fingerprint is 1f:51:ae:28:df:63:e9:d8:cf:38:5d:87:2d:7b:b8:ca:9f:f5:b1:6f. 
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

Type yes and press enter.

You'll see a response similar to the following:

Warning: Permanently added 'ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

You should then see the welcome screen for your instance and you are now connected to your AWS Linux virtual machine in the cloud.


Step 4: Terminate Your Instance
a. EC2 console > instance > actions > Instance state > Terminate
b. confirm yes to terminate


Launch a Windows Virtual Machine
================================
Step 1: Enter the EC2 Dashboard
EC2 > console

Step 2: Create and Configure Your Virtual Machine
a. launch instance
b. Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base > select 
c. instance type > t2.micro > Review and launch
d. default options > launch

Step 3: Create a Key Pair and Launch Your Instance
a. popover > select "create a new key pair" > name: "MyKeyPair" > Download key pair > MyFirstKey.pem

Windows users: We recommend saving your key pair in your user directory in a sub-directory called .ssh (ex.C:\user\{yourusername}\.ssh\MyFirstKey.pem).
Mac/Linux users: We recommend saving your key pair in the .ssh sub-directory from your home directory (ex.~/.ssh/MyFirstKey.pem). 

b. Launch instance
c. on the next screen "View instances" > status

Step 4: Connect to Your Instance
connect using RDP

a. select instance > connect
b. login
The User name defaults to Administrator
To receive your password, click Get Password
c. choose MyFirstKey.pem > Decrypt password
d. save decrypted password in a safe location

Step 6: Connect to Your Instance
RDP client
a. Click download remote desktop file
b. enter username and password
you should be logged in!!

Step 7: Terminate Your Windows VM
a. EC2 Consolle > select instance > actions > Instance state > Terminate
b. confirm yes to terminate
