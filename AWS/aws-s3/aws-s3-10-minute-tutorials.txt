AWS S3 Tutorials:
==============

creating a bucket:
-------------------
S3 > Create bucket > unique name + region > create
bucket > select > upload > upload file or drag n drop

Backup Files to Amazon S3 using the AWS CLI
---------------------------------------------
Step 1: create login for aws console:
IAM > Users > Create > username: AWS_Admin > Permissions > Attach policy > AdministratorFullAccess 
> Manage password > Auto generated, uncheck require password change > apply
> Download credentials > credentials.csv

Step 2: install and configure aws cli
download AWSCLI64.msi > install > windows run > cmd  

Type aws configure and press enter. Enter the following when prompted:

AWS Access Key ID [None]: enter the Access Key Id from the credentials.csv file you downloaded in step 1 part d

Note: this should look something like AKIAPWINCOKAO3U4FWTN
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: enter the Secret Access Key from the credentials.csv file you downloaded in step 1 part d

Note: this should look something like 5dqQFBaGuPNf5z7NhFrgou4V5JJNaWPy1XFzBfX3

Default region name [None]: enter us-east-1
Default output format [None]: enter json

Step 3: Using the AWS CLI with Amazon S3
a. Creating a bucket is optional if you already have a bucket created that you want to use. 
To create a new bucket named my-first-backup-bucket type aws s3 mb s3://my-first-backup-bucket

Note: bucket naming has some restrictions; one of those restrictions is that bucket names must be globally unique (e.g. two different AWS users can not have the same bucket name);
because of this, if you try the command above you will get a BucketAlreadyExists error.

b. To upload the file my-first-backup.bak located in the local directory to the S3 bucket my-first-backup-bucket, 
you would use the following command: 
aws s3 cp my-first-backup.bak s3://my-first-backup-bucket/

c. To download my-first-backup.bak from S3 to the local directory we would reverse the order of the commands as follows: 
aws s3 cp s3://my-first-backup-bucket/my-first-backup.bak ./

d. To delete my-first-backup.bak from your my-first-backup-bucket bucket, use the following command: 
aws s3 rm s3://my-first-backup-bucket/my-first-backup.bak

additional commands 
recursively copying local files to s3
aws s3 cp myDir s3://mybucket/ --recursive --exclude "*.jpg"

recursively remove files (with caution!)
aws s3 rm myDir s3://mybucket/ --recursive --exclude "*.jpg"

list files:
aws s3 ls s3://mybucket

remove bucket:
$ aws s3 rb s3://bucket-name
or
$ aws s3 rb s3://bucket-name --force
