# TIL (Today I Learned)

Inspired by @jbranchaud's [repo](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) and @thoughtbot's [repo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til)

This project is a collection of small things I learn about different languages, frameworks and technologies.
It consists of short markdown documents s (a few sentences + example code) summarising concepts or tips I'd have learned.
The goal is to write something new everyday or as often as possible.

Currently: 0 TILs
